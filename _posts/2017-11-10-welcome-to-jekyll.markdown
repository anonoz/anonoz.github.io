I am a terribly lazy blogger. I rarely update my blog. Maybe a change of scenery will help.

Several reasons are driving me to give Jekyll a test drive:
- It seems simpler and easier to use than Wordpress.
- I would like more controls and customization options over my own homepage, rather than giving up control to WP themes.
- I am trying to have a platform-agnostic way to edit, render, and generate resume. It seems like a simple markdown page that uses CSS print media query will work fine.
