Facebook is really low-barrier, low-effort way for me to do occasional brain dumps to a tiny bit of audience. Half of the time, I can get dozens of likes. Another half, just 1-2. I enjoyed having attention, I loved them Likes.

Since last year September, I have installed News Feed Eradicator on my Chrome. I have to admit, the news feed is addicting as hell and it’s not good to me and my ongoing final year project. I was really addicted and would spend hours scrolling through it, especially on autopilot.

After 1 year of not having news feed, I feel a lot more liberated. Although I now spend more time on Reddit, but I find Reddit way more informative and entertaining, much more than people showing off their perfect lives on Facebook.

I kept Facebook mainly for my computer science degree group (important announcements), promote my club events, stay on the tech job groups like [WCKL Jobs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wckljobs/).

It probably is time to say goodbye to Facebook.

You can still get to me via:

- [Telegram](https://t.me/anonoz) – my favorite!
- [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/anonoz) – you can actually deactivate Facebook without giving this up

After 9 years, I wonder what life without Facebook is like.

P/S: I have also deleted accounts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Tinder and etc.
